1. Data input
    a. Data capture
        - get data from a CSV with a particular format
        - possibly integrate with Google Sheets API later
    b. Data sanitation / validation
        - deal with caps / trailing space / extra spaces
        - check against master list
        - alert user to any that do not match (manual step)
    c. Data conversion
        - turn data in dictionary --> "person" : ["choice 1", "choice 2", "choice 3"]

2. Assignment algorithm
    a. create an array for each possible assignment
    b. assign everyone to their number 1 choice
    c. iterate through all choices
        - for each choice with more than the maximum, select those who should be moved
        - move them
    d. repeat for second and third choices
    e. for all those still not categorized, assign them to random options that are not filled

3. Data output
    a. Turn data into a spreadsheet
        - convert array to CSV
        - figure out how to add multiple tabs to spreadsheet
        - possible interface with Google Sheets API ?
